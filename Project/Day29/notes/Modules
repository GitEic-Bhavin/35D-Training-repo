Terraform Modules
To make simplicity for deploy multiple resources.

Module Structure

modules/
├── ec2
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── variable.tf
├── main.tf
├── security_group
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── variable.tf
└── vpc
    ├── main.tf
    └── variable.tf

modules/main.tf – used for passing or override the varible values.

terraform.tfvars
instance_type = “t3.medium”
region = “us-east-1”
environment = “Production”
instnace_name = “prod-ec2”

This instance_type should be exists in the variable.tf file.

modules/ec2/variable.tf -- 
variable “instance_type” {
	type = string
}

# here we did not give default = “t2.micor” Right ?
# so, it will look for this value into terraform.tfvars 

terraform.tfvars
instance_type = “t2.micor”
region = “us-east-1”

# from here, the variable.tf file will fetch variable vaule.
# if still value did not give in terraform.tfvars file, then it will ask to you to enter value in run time during terrafom apply, terraform plan.


WorkSpace
If you want to deploy same resources but with diff region, diff department, diff appilcations. You have to use workspace.

All main.tf will remain same. But only terraform.tfvars file for each department, region, applications will be diff.

You have to only apply this terraform.tfvars during apply.
terraform.tfvars only use to assing value of variables in the variable.tf file.


Manage State file on remote S3 location with DynamoDB tables

DynamoDB Properties to be used
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name terraform-state-lock \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
    --region us-west-2


Lock terraform.tfstate file
Why ?
Ex. we have 2 deveoper. D1 – Will manage and create vpc. D2 – Will manage and create EC2 Instance.
If Both D1 and D2 will execute at same time. terrafom.tfstate file will not changed at same time.
There are conflict generate.
Nobody can not execute at same time. 
If First Execution done completely then Second Execution will run.
But, How Terraform will decide this is First Execution , this is Second Execution ?
Based on LockID.
Each LockID will assigned to Each Developer.
While New Developer is added into team. A LockID will genereate for new deveoper.
But, where this LockID will be save ?
Locally we can’t save this LockID bcz, of Security reasons.
We have to Manage this LockID in DynamoDB Database.
While First Execution is runnig. The terrafom.tfstate file is lock for other all Developers.

At a time only one Execution is possible.
To setup Upload terrafom.tfstate file on Remote Server Directly.
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  tags = {
    Name        = var.instance_name
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
