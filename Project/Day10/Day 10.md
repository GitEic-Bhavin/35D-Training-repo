**Time: 1 Hour**

**Project Overview:** Develop a comprehensive shell script for sysops to automate system monitoring and generate detailed reports. The script will leverage advanced Linux shell scripting techniques to monitor system metrics, capture logs, and provide actionable insights for system administrators.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Script Initialization:**  
   * Initialize script with necessary variables and configurations.  
   * Validate required commands and utilities availability.  
1. **System Metrics Collection:**  
   * Monitor CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network statistics.  
   * Capture process information including top processes consuming resources. 

   ```bash
      System_Metric() {
      echo "Show System Metrics"
      echo
      echo "===================="
      Disk_Usage=$(top -bn1 | grep  "Cpu(s)" |  sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/")
      echo $Disk_Usage

      echo
      echo "Network Statistics"
      echo "===================="
      echo
      echo "NetworkStat=$(netstat -i)"
      echo 
      echo
      echo "Show Top Process"
      echo
      echo "====================="
      echo
      echo "TP=$(top | head -n 10)"
      echo
      echo
      echo "======================"
      echo
      echo "Memory Usage=$(free -h | head -n 10)"
      echo
      echo
      echo "======================="
      echo
      echo "Disk Space=$(df -h )"
      echo
      echo

    }
   ```

1. **Log Analysis:**  
   * Parse system logs (e.g., syslog) for critical events and errors.  
   * Generate summaries of recent log entries based on severity.  

   ```bash
    Log_analysis () {

      if [ -e /var/log/syslog ]
    then 
        grep -iE  "ERROR|CRITICAL" /var/log/syslog | tail -n 10 
    fi
    }
    Log_analysis

   ```


1. **Health Checks:**  
   * Check the status of essential services (e.g., Apache, MySQL).  
   * Verify connectivity to external services or databases.  
   ```bash
    Health_Check() {
      echo
      echo "Show Service is active or disabled"
      echo
      echo "==========================="
      echo
      echo "Apache-Service=$(systemctl is-active apache2)"
      echo
      echo "Mysql-Service=$(systemctl is-active mysql)"
      echo
      echo "Check Ping"
      echo
      echo "============================"
      echo
      ping -c1 google.com
      if [ $? == 0 ]
      then 
        echo "Google is reachable by sending 1 Pkg."
      else
        echo "Google is unreachable"
      fi
    }
   ```
1. **Alerting Mechanism:**  
   * Implement thresholds for critical metrics (CPU, memory) triggering alerts.  
   * Send email notifications to sysadmins with critical alerts.  
1. **Report Generation:**  
   * Compile all collected data into a detailed report.  
   * Include graphs or visual representations where applicable. 

   ```bash
    echo "Creating report file"

    Report_file="/tmp/Day10-report_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').txt"
    echo "System Report $(date)" >> $Report_file
    System_Metric >> $Report_file
    Health_Check >> $Report_file
    Threshhold >> $Report_file
    Log_analysis >> $Report_file
   ``` 
1. **Automation and Scheduling:**  
   * Configure the script to run periodically via cron for automated monitoring.  
   * Ensure the script can handle both interactive and non-interactive execution modes.  
1. **User Interaction:**  
   * Provide options for interactive mode to allow sysadmins to manually trigger checks or view specific metrics.  
   * Ensure the script is user-friendly with clear prompts and outputs.  
1. **Documentation:**  
   * Create a README file detailing script usage, prerequisites, and customization options.  
   * Include examples of typical outputs and how to interpret them.

**Optional Enhancements (if time permits):**

* **Database Integration:**  
  * Store collected metrics in a database for historical analysis.  
* **Web Interface:**  
  * Develop a basic web interface using shell scripting (with CGI) for remote monitoring and reporting.  
* **Customization:**  
  * Allow customization of thresholds and monitoring parameters via configuration files.

### 

### **1\. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

* **Scenario**: A software development team wants to automate the build, test, and deployment process to ensure faster and more reliable releases.  
* **Solution**: Jenkins can be configured to automatically pull code from a version control system (like Git), build the code, run tests, and deploy the application to various environments (staging, production, etc.).  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Configure Jenkins to trigger a build when changes are pushed to the repository.  
  1. Set up build steps to compile the code and run unit tests.  
  1. Integrate with tools like JUnit for test reporting.  
  1. Deploy the built application to the desired environment using plugins for Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

### **2\. Automating Code Quality Checks**

* **Scenario**: A team wants to ensure that every code commit meets specific quality standards before merging it into the main branch.  
* **Solution**: Use Jenkins to run static code analysis tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle, or PMD as part of the CI pipeline.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Configure Jenkins to trigger a build on pull request creation.  
  1. Integrate static code analysis tools into the build process.  
  1. Generate reports and fail the build if code quality metrics do not meet predefined thresholds.  
  1. Send feedback to the development team via email or Slack.

### **3\. Automated Testing**

* **Scenario**: A QA team wants to run automated tests on multiple environments and devices to ensure the software works as expected.  
* **Solution**: Jenkins can run automated test suites using tools like Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, or Appium.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Configure Jenkins to trigger test runs on schedule or after a build.  
  1. Use Jenkins agents to run tests on different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) or devices (emulators, real devices).  
  1. Collect and publish test results and logs.  
  1. Notify stakeholders of test results via email or chat.

### **4\. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

* **Scenario**: A DevOps team wants to manage infrastructure using code and automate the provisioning of resources.  
* **Solution**: Use Jenkins to automate the execution of IaC scripts written in tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Store IaC scripts in a version control repository.  
  1. Configure Jenkins to trigger a job when changes are made to the IaC scripts.  
  1. Run the IaC scripts to provision or update infrastructure.  
  1. Monitor the job for successful completion and handle any errors.

### **5\. Automated Deployment of Microservices**

* **Scenario**: A team is developing a microservices-based architecture and needs to deploy multiple services independently.  
* **Solution**: Jenkins can manage the build and deployment pipeline for each microservice.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Configure a separate Jenkins job for each microservice.  
  1. Trigger builds based on changes to individual repositories.  
  1. Build Docker images for each microservice.  
  1. Use Jenkins to deploy the images to a Kubernetes cluster or other container orchestration platform.

### **6\. Monitoring and Alerting**

* **Scenario**: An operations team wants to monitor the health and performance of Jenkins jobs and receive alerts for failures.  
* **Solution**: Integrate Jenkins with monitoring and alerting tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or ELK Stack.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Use Jenkins plugins to expose metrics to Prometheus.  
  1. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize Jenkins job performance.  
  1. Configure alerting rules to notify the team of job failures or performance issues via email, Slack, or other communication tools.

### **7\. Security and Compliance Automation**

* **Scenario**: An organization needs to ensure that all code and deployments adhere to security and compliance standards.  
* **Solution**: Use Jenkins to run security scans and compliance checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. Integrate security tools like OWASP ZAP, Snyk, or Clair into the Jenkins pipeline.  
  1. Run security scans on application code and container images.  
  1. Generate reports and fail builds if vulnerabilities are detected.  
  1. Automate compliance checks using scripts or tools like OpenSCAP.
